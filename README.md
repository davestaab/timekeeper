# What is this?

Do you have to track time at work? Are you busy?

If you're like me and have to bill clients/projects or just want to know how you've spent your day

Do you have to track time at work? Do you find yourself counting hours between events that happened throughout the day? You started working, handled a crisis, went to lunch, scrambled for a meeting, caught up on email, shew....

So how much time did you spend on project A? How much on administration? How much on Project B?

If you're like me, you end up counting hours between the events of the day. And then adding up the different categories to figure out a subtotal

# How does it work?

# Questions?
